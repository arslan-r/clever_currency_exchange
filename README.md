# clever_currency_exchange
Traveling? Can't wrap your head around the currency exchange rate? Take a picture of the price tag and you will find your answer. Goal is to design an app that's easier to use than manually typing in numbers.





## DESIGN PLAN

I got the basic design down. Here is what to do next.
Implement the currency exchange feature by hard coding currency rates. Get that working. Should be ez pz.
* Find a resource that will provide you with a list of all currencies and their current rates. 
* Would be downloaded when user starts up app for the frst time. 

Get the Camera to take photos.
* Save the image temporarily.
* Process image, pull out information.
  * Plug information into currencyFrom right away.

Should be pretty much it. Make it pretty. Throw in an animation. Maybe a plane? Skies are cool. Make it a sky blue and white theme.
* When users first start the app, ask them what they will most likely be converting from and into what currency.
  * Make sure to not show that screen again.
  * save those preferences, until they change it themselves through the scroll down menu
  
See if its possible to start the app right away by double pressing volume buttons
See if you can rewire the pixel squeeze to open the app
* might be useful when an individual has gloves on/its cold

  
## HOW APP SHOULD FUNCTION

- User opens app. Snaps a pic. Instantly gets a conversion. No internet required.
- Easy. Breezy. Beautiful.
