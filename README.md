Traveling? Can't wrap your head around the currency exchange rate? Point the camera and you will find your answer. The goal is to design an app that's easier to use than manually typing in numbers.

# clever_currency_exchange
Using image processing and computer vission, this app allows a live feed of a foreign price tag to be converted into your homeland currency.

# Future Implementations

Make it pretty. Throw in an animation on start up. Maybe a plane? Skies are cool. Make it a sky blue and white theme.
* When users first start the app, ask them their home country (convert into). What to convert from (where they are traveling).
  * Make sure to not show that screen again.
  * save those preferences, until they change it themselves through the country spinner
  
See if its possible to start the app right away by double pressing volume buttons
See if you can rewire the pixel squeeze to open the app
* might be useful when an individual has gloves on/its cold

  
# Possible issues
* Need to obtain a dataset/constantly updated resource of all countries current exchange rates. 
  * CONS: Costs money to provide such service.
  * Maybe start a server, pull data for free every 30 minutes, link app to server?
   * Users might not use data as they are traveling. Roaming is expensive. Give them option when to update their currency rates.

- User opens app. Instantly gets a conversion. No internet required.
- Easy. Breezy. Beautiful.
